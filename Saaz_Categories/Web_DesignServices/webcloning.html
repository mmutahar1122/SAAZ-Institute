    <h1 class="text-primary fw-bold">When your 'free' website building platform isn't free anymore</h1>
    <h3>Why clone a website?</h3>
    <p>if you stuck in a contract with your last web designer or website building (such as Wix) and can't escape and
        spending more than you need to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you are afraid of losing your current website, you have spent thousand of pounds on or countless hours
            building.</li>
        <li>you have found out you don't own the website you are just renting it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is where website cloning comes in, it allows you to clone an old website and we can move it to a WordPress
        CMS platform.</p>
    <p>Once the website has been cloned, you'll be able to have an almost identical version for a fraction of the cost.
        You will also own the website and be able to move it any time you want.</p>
    <p>You will be able to look forward to a more cost-effective website following the migration of yuour current site's
        content and loyout onto Wordpress.</p>
    <p>We will show you the finished site before we launch it lbe and so you can check that the site is just as you wht
        it.</p>
