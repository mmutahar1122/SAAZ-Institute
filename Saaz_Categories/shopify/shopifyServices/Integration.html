            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">Make Shopify Provide Shopify Integration Service In USA, what do you need to succeed as an e-commerce brand? Good product, that’s one. Flawless customer support, that’s two. Knowing what exactly your customers expect from you is three. And smoothly managing all the internal aspects of your shop is four. But if the supply chain, sales department, and accounting all work in a silo, then getting lost on who is responsible for what is, unfortunately, a daily thing.</p>
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Integrate your Shopify store with ERP systems</h2>
            
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">If you, as a merchant, have multiple Shopify stores under your name, then not getting lost in the chaos is even trickier. This is where ecommerce brands but not only use an ERP system to turn chaos into order and ensure everyone is on the same page.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">However, picking a Shopify ERP integration platform and adding it to the store isn’t as simple as it might seem – there are plenty of things you need to research first and a couple of challenges to face. In this guide, we’ll help you with all that – we’ll show you the basics of Shopify ERP integrations, the benefits of having one in the shop, and how to ensure that it fits like a glove with Shopify.</p>

            <h2 class="fw-bold">What is ERP Integration?</h2>
            
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">In essence, ERP integration is a method to connect and synchronize the enterprise resource planning software with other applications & data sources you use in the company, creating one single database with all the data. That way, the integrated platform can give you a unified view of data from different systems & departments in real-time, as well as allow you to update the data in all systems at once.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">Plus, having one integrated system rather than multiple ones for each department can make a lot of things easier for your team & give them a significant boost in productivity but not only. When the whole data is in one place, then not only does everyone has access to the same information, but they also can share it much easier with others, visibly improving the communication & collaboration between different teams.</p>
           
            <h2 class="fw-bold">Shopify CRM Integration</h2>
            
            <p class="fw-medium fs-5">Manage your customers in a better way and offer them a pleasant user experience through Shopify CRM integration.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">But there’s one more solution you should consider if you aren’t using it already – CRM or the Customer Relationship management app. More than 91% of companies with ten or more employees use a CRM to manage customer conversations, according to Grandview Research. The CRM analytics section is also among the fastest-growing areas of CX technology.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">But what even is a CRM platform, and how can you integrate it with the Shopify store (and other apps you are using)? And what are the best software you should consider for your Shopify business? We’ll answer all your questions in a moment.</p>
           
            <h2 class="fw-bold">What is a CRM system?</h2>
            
            <p class="fw-medium fs-5">A CRM system (Customer Relationship Management system) is a handy tool used by the sales and customer support team to keep track of the leads and customers’ data. The goal is simple – improve the relationships with the new and existing customers to grow your business.
            </p>
            <p class="text-secondary fw-medium fs-5">It actually works similarly to an ERP solution – but instead of gathering and storing data about the products you are selling; it instead collects data related to the customers:</p>
